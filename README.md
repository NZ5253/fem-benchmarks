# FEM Benchmarks (Fortran + MATLAB)

This repository catalogues textbook FEM benchmark examples and provides MATLAB runners
to execute the Fortran codes reproducibly.

## Structure
- benchmarks/: metadata entries (one per benchmark) + index
- matlab/: MATLAB runner scripts
- fortran/: (optional) Fortran sources if redistribution is allowed
- docs/: how-to guides
- scripts/: helpers (index builders, scanners, etc.)
